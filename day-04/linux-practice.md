# Day 04 – Linux Practice: Processes and Services 🚀

## Process Management Commands

| Command | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| `ps aux` | Show all running processes |
| `top` | Real-time process monitoring |
| `pgrep ssh` | Find process ID by name |
| `jobs` | Show active background jobs |
| `kill PID` | Stop a running process |
| `kill -9 PID` | Force terminate a process |

---

## Service Management Commands

| Command | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| `systemctl status ssh` | Check status of SSH service |
| `systemctl list-units --type=service` | List active system services |
| `systemctl restart ssh` | Restart a service |
| `systemctl stop service-name` | Stop a service |
| `systemctl start service-name` | Start a service |
| `systemctl enable service-name` | Enable service at boot |

---

## Log Monitoring Commands

| Command | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| `journalctl -u ssh` | View logs for SSH service |
| `journalctl -xe` | View detailed system logs |
| `tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog` | View last 50 log lines |
| `tail -f /var/log/syslog` | Monitor logs in real time |
| `dmesg` | View kernel logs |
| `uptime` | Show system uptime |

---

## Mini Troubleshooting Workflow

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Checked if SSH process was running using `pgrep ssh` |
| 2 | Verified SSH service status using `systemctl status ssh` |
| 3 | Inspected service logs using `journalctl -u ssh` |
| 4 | Restarted SSH service using `systemctl restart ssh` |
| 5 | Confirmed service recovery and active status |

# Service Inspected Today

For today’s practice, the following Linux service was inspected:

- SSH Service (`ssh`)

Activities performed:

- Verified service status
- Checked running process
- Viewed service logs
- Restarted the service
- Confirmed successful operation

---

# What I Learned Today

- Understanding Linux process management
- Managing services using `systemctl`
- Reading and analyzing system logs
- Troubleshooting Linux services
- Monitoring active processes and services

---

# Why These Commands Matter in DevOps

These commands are important because they help in:

- Monitoring production servers
- Managing critical services
- Diagnosing application failures
- Troubleshooting server issues
- Investigating logs and system events
- Maintaining Linux server health

Linux process and service management are core skills required for DevOps and System Administration roles.

# Commands Practiced Summary

| Category | Commands Covered |
|----------|------------------|
| Process Commands | `ps`, `top`, `pgrep`, `kill` |
| Service Commands | `systemctl status`, `systemctl restart`, `systemctl list-units` |
| Log Commands | `journalctl`, `tail`, `dmesg` |

---

# Practice Outcome

This hands-on Linux practice improved my understanding of:

- Process monitoring
- Service lifecycle management
- Linux logging systems
- Basic troubleshooting techniques

These are essential day-to-day skills for working in Linux-based DevOps environments.
